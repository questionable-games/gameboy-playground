This project is a compilation of documentation from the web
and examples to be used as reference in our future
developments. It doesn't try to be a reference for anyone
else, however we feel sharing our notes and experiences could
be of some help for someone else, so we decided to make our
personal notes public.

As notes, they will contain parts of other documents we
consider relevant for us and we want to compile for easier
future reference.

**All the credit must be for the authors of the tutorials and documents mentioned**.
We will always try to add links to the original source.
